                                    When applying trigonometric identities, a common mistake is to forget or confuse formulas as well as the intuition behind their construction. Remember that, where intuition might fail, higher-level
                                    patterns might instead be used to reconstruct formulas and aid recall.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <br />
                                </p>
                                <p>In some cases, patterns extend across identities:</p>
                                <p>
                                    <br />

                                    Both the half-angle and power-reducing formulas involve functions <i>f</i>(<i>t</i>) = (1 &ndash; cos(<i>t</i>))/2 and <i>g</i>(<i>t</i>) = (1 + cos(<i>t</i>))/2. For both sets of identities, the formulas
                                    corresponding to: sin invoke <i>f</i>(<i>t</i>), cos invoke <i>g</i>(<i>t</i>), and tan invoke <i>f</i>(<i>t</i>)/<i>g</i>(<i>t</i>). Half-angle formulas take the square root of, while power-reducing
                                    formulas double the parameter value of, each invocation.
                                </p>

                                </p>
                                <p>The angle sum/difference formulas compose the double angle formulas, so committing the latter to memory is unnecessary.</p>
                                <p>
                                    <br />

                                    Patterns can take on any number of forms and scope. A direct relationship between sum/difference-to-product and product-to-sum/difference identities can be more difficult to establish. As one example:
                                </p>
                                <p>

                                    On either side of the equation are a product of two trigonometric functions and a binomial of two trigonometric functions.
                                </p>
                                <p>On the left side of the equation (i.e. initial expression), the parameter values are angles <i>a</i> and <i>b.</i></p>
                                <p>On the right side of the equation (i.e. final expression), the parameter values are angles (<i>a </i>+/<i>&ndash;</i> <i>b</i>) and (<i>a &ndash;</i>/+ <i>b</i>).</p>
                                <p>
                                    For a product of both sine and cosine, the equivalent binomial is a form of sine +/&ndash; sine, and the angles on the right side of the equation are (<i>a</i> + <i>b</i>) and (<i>a</i> &ndash; <i>b</i>).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    For a product of either sine or cosine, the equivalent binomial is a form of cosine +/&ndash; cosine, and the angles on the right side of the equation are (<i>a</i> &ndash; <i>b</i>) and (<i>a</i> +
                                    <i>b</i>).

                                    For a product where the second function is cosine, the terms of the equivalent binomial are added.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    For a product where the second function is sine, the terms of the equivalent binomial are subtracted.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    For a binomial on the left side of the equation, the product on the right side of the equation is multiplied by two, and each angle is divided by two.

                                    For a product on the left side of the equation, each term of the (or, the entire) binomial on right side of the equation is divided by two.

                                    When applying <i>u</i>-substitution to an expression, a common mistake is to forget or confuse elements of the <i>dx</i> substitute when attempting the operation mentally<i>. </i>Remember to write out the

                                    When re-applying integration by parts to an expression <i>xy</i>, where <i>u</i> equals <i>x</i> and <i>v</i> equals the antiderivative of <i>y</i>, a common mistake is to set<i> u</i> equal to the
                                    <i>y</i>-term. Remember that, in subsequent applications of integration by parts, <i>u</i> equals the derivative of the <i>x</i>-term from the previous step.

                                    When integrating trigonometric and/or exponential functions where one of the limits of integration is 0, a common mistake is to dismiss the integral evaluated at the limit of 0. Remember to evaluate each
                                    term at both limits even if the integrand does not contain trigonometric or exponential functions, as frequent dismissal, even where valid in some cases, makes mental error in other cases more likely.

                                    forms an angle <i>&Phi; </i>with the horizontal equal to tan<sup>-1</sup>(1/<i>a</i>), which is found intuitively by converting variables from Cartesian to spherical within the equation of the cone.

                                <p>When visually assessing the direction of curl for a vector field <i>F</i>, a common mistake is to misapply the right-hand rule and reverse the direction. Remember this alternate approach:</p>

                                    a. For each axis, visualize (i.e. tilt, for a non-vertical axis) the graph to where the axis is situated in the vertical position (typically associated with <i>z</i>). For example, if the <i>y</i>-axis
                                    was horizontal, tilt all the elements in the graph along with the<i> y</i>-axis until<i> y</i> is vertical (assuming the typical position of<i> z</i>).<i> </i>While so doing, view the vector field against
                                    that axis from a two-dimensional perspective (agnostic to one of two horizontal axes), determining whether individual vectors in the field cross each other. For example, a cylindrical rotation about that
                                    axis would in two dimensions demonstrate crossing between individual vectors that, in three dimensions, would be in front of and behind the axis. Crossing indicates rotation.

                                    b. When rotation is identified, again tilt that vertical axis down so that it is perpendicular to your line of vision. For example, the axis would point directly toward your eyes on the positive side and
                                    directly away from your eyes on the negative side. View the vector field from this perspective and visualize drawing a circle around the axis, following the direction of the vectors. Assess whether that
                                    circle is being drawn in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction. That direction indicates the direction of curl (clockwise is negative; counterclockwise is positive).

                                    When interpreting the motion of a satellite in circular orbit, a common mistake is to assume that the satellite maintains its speed by forward acceleration. Remember that a satellite with constant speed
                                    <i>v </i>has no tangential (forward) acceleration <i>a </i>= <i>dv</i>/<i>dt</i>, where the derivative of constant <i>v</i> is 0. In that case and generally-speaking, the only force acting on a satellite
                                    in circular orbit is centripetal (central) acceleration caused by gravitational force. The force being perpendicular to the direction of tangential velocity has neither positive nor negative effect on
                                    speed. Despite being in free fall, the reason that the satellite is not pulled to the ground is that its tangential velocity produces a trajectory that matches the curvature of the planet, sufficient to
                                    offset the constant gravitational pull toward the planet center which balances the angular motion of the satellite.

                                    When interpreting the non-motion of a person seated on a chair, a common mistake is to assume that no horizontal forces act on the person, and that spinal compression is generated exclusively by the
                                    combined effect of the gravitational force pulling downward toward the plane of Earth and the normal force pushing upward from the plane of the seat. Remember that a person seated in a perfectly
                                    smooth-surface chair likely (depending on the angle of the seat and the posture of the person) slips at a speed no greater than

                                    Linear Algebra studies the properties of, and approaches to solving, systems of linear equations, or linear systems. Linear systems appear in real-life contexts when more than one linear equation
                                    describes a process. A linear equation can be expressed as&nbsp;<i>a1</i><i><b>x1</b></i><i>+a2</i><i><b>x2</b></i><i>+&hellip;+an</i><i><b>xn</b></i><i>=&nbsp;</i><i><b>b</b></i>, where {<i><b>x1</b></i>
                                    <i>,&nbsp;</i><i><b>x2</b></i>,&hellip;,&nbsp;<i><b>xn</b></i>} is a set of unknown variables, and {<i>a1,&nbsp;a2,&hellip;,&nbsp;an</i>} is a set of coefficients that, each, correspond to an unknown
                                    variable of the same index. Where linear equations within the same system are expressed with the same unknown variables, the solution to an unknown variable in one equation of the system can be
                                    substituted into all instances of the same unknown variable in other equations of the system. A solution to the linear system is a set of values {<i><b>s1</b></i><i>,&nbsp;</i>
                                    <i><b>s2</b></i>,&hellip;,&nbsp;} that, when substituted into the unknown variables of the corresponding indeces, makes all linear equations of the system true statements. A system may have more than one
                                    solution, where substitution of different combinations of values into the unknowns of the system makes the system true. The set of all possible solutions is a solution set. One approach to solving a
                                    system of linear equations is to express one linear equation in terms of a single variable, then substitute that expression into instances of the single variable within other equations of the system in
                                    order to reduce the number of unknowns, repeating the process until a solution can be determined. Because not all linear systems have a solution (i.e. are not solveable), one might not learn of this fact
                                    until exhausting all possible substitutions. Linear Algebra studies more efficient approaches to solving systems of linear equations, by representing the coefficients of each linear equation as a row
                                    within a matrix. One such approach involves the application of computationally-efficient algorithms called row reduction operations.

                                    Row reduction operations, which are applied to the rows of a matrix, comprise a set of permitted operations: a. replacing one row by the sum of itself and the scale of another row; b. interchanging the
                                    order of two rows; c. scalar multiplying a row by a nonzero constant.
                                    <br />
                                    Row reduction operations are applied in such a way as to manipulate the entries of the matrix to embody a particular form: namely,<i>row echelon</i>&nbsp;(zeros beneathe and to the left of each leading
                                    entry) and&nbsp;<i>reduced row echelon</i>&nbsp;(zeros beneath, to the left of and above each leading entry, where each leading entry must also be the number one). From the properties of these forms can
                                    be inferred properties of the associated system of equations, including solutions of the system. A matrix that positions the&nbsp;<i><b>b</b></i>&nbsp;value, from the linear equation&nbsp;<i>a1</i>
                                    <i><b>x1</b></i><i>+a2</i><i><b>x2</b></i><i>+&hellip;+an</i><i><b>xn</b></i><i>=&nbsp;</i><i><b>b</b></i><i>,</i>&nbsp;into the rightmost column of the matrix is called an&nbsp;
                                    <i>augmented matrix.</i>&nbsp;After reduction to reduced row echelon form, the resulting values of the augmented matrix indicate the ability (or inability) to solve for<i><b>x</b></i>, or&nbsp;{
                                    <i><b>x1</b></i><i>,&nbsp;</i><i><b>x2</b></i>,&hellip;,&nbsp;<i><b>xn</b></i>}.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Take, for example, a system of linear equations {2<i><b>x1</b></i><i>+</i>6<i><b>x2</b></i>=6,&nbsp;<i><b>x1</b></i><i>+2</i><i><b>x2</b></i><i>=</i>2}. In augmented matrix form, the two rows may be
                                    interchanged, moving [1 2 2] from the second row to the first row, and [2 6 6] from the first row to the second row. The second row of [2 6 6] may be replaced with the sum of itself, and the first row of
                                    [1 2 2] scaled by a factor of -2, to yield [0 2 2] for the second row and [1 2 2] for the first row. The form of this matrix is called&nbsp;<i>echelon form</i>, and indicates the location of
                                    the&nbsp;<i>pivots</i>, or leading entries, for each row (1st&nbsp;column in the first row; 2nd&nbsp;column in the 2nd&nbsp;row). The second row may then be scaled by a factor of &frac12; to yield [0 1 1]
                                    for the second row. Replacing the first row with the sum of itself, and the second row scaled by a factor of -2, yields [1 0 0] for the first row and [0 1 1] for the second row. The form of this matrix is
                                    called&nbsp;<i>reduced row echelon&nbsp;</i>form, and indicates the solution for row equivalent matrices. Row equivalent matrices are matrices that, with any combination of row reduction operations, yield
                                    the same matrix in reduced row echelon form. Here, the first row indicates that&nbsp;<i><b>x1&nbsp;</b></i>equals 0 and the second row indicates that&nbsp;<i><b>x2&nbsp;</b></i>equals 1. Thus, the
                                    solution of the linear system is {0, 1}.

                                    The linear equation&nbsp;<i>a1</i><i><b>x1</b></i><i>+a2</i><i><b>x2</b></i><i>+&hellip;+an</i><i><b>xn</b></i><i>=&nbsp;</i><i><b>b&nbsp;</b></i>can be expressed in different forms: as a vector equation,
                                    a matrix equation, or a linear transformation. As a vector equation, a1&nbsp;is the first column,&nbsp;<i>a2</i>&nbsp;is the second column, and&nbsp;<i><b>b</b></i>&nbsp;is the last columnof the augmented
                                    matrix in reduced row echelon form i.e. [1; 0]<i><b>x1</b></i>&nbsp;+ [0; 1]<i><b>x2</b></i>&nbsp;= [0; 1]. (In the preceding example and hereforth, a semicolon inside of a matrix indicates a separate
                                    row, so, for example, two matrix entries separated by a semicolon indicates a two row, single column matrix i.e. a column vector.) As a matrix equation&nbsp;<i>A</i><i><b>x</b></i><i>=</i><i><b>b</b></i>,
                                    matrix&nbsp;<i>A&nbsp;</i>is composed as [<i>a1a2&nbsp;an</i>] and the augmented column of the reduced row echelon form of [&nbsp;<i>A |</i>&nbsp;<i><b>b</b></i>&nbsp;] is&nbsp;<i><b>x</b></i>.As a linear

                                    The initial concepts introduced in Linear Algebra form the basis that spans all subsequent concepts. This is particularly true when vectors of the vector equation are connoted as vector spaces, when the
                                    linear combination&nbsp;<i><b>b</b></i>&nbsp;of the matrix equation takes the form of the eigenvector scaled by an eigenvalue, and, for linear transformations, when&nbsp;<i><b>x</b></i>&nbsp;becomes the
                                    kernel (or null space) which maps to the zero vector, and&nbsp;<i>T(</i><i><b>x</b></i><i>)</i>&nbsp;the range (or column space) which maps from a vector&nbsp;<i><b>x</b></i>. The study of Linear Algebra
                                    involves viewing much of the same phenomena from different perspectives where they can be applied to different types of problems. Gaining the early intuition makes subsequent learning less of a surprise
                                    and more of a natural progression. Meanwhile, the unfolding of new considerations adds depth and meaning to prior learning, so regularly surveying learned concepts may be helpful for better appreciating
                                    interconnections.

                                    When first approaching a quantitative Physics problem, I recommend the following: Visualize the problem i.e. Try to develop an intuitive sense of what is happening and an expectation of what should occur,
                                    and draw a diagram. List all known variables alongside their quantities, as well as the unknown variable. Also list known formulas that most closely relate to the logical conditions present in the
                                    problem. The formulas will need to form a bridge between the given inputs and the desired output. Start with the formula for which the most variables are known. Rearrange the formula so that an unknown
                                    variable is isolated on one side. If more than one unknown variable exists, consider whether the problem implies or infers other quantities that are not explicitly given, and whether such quantities would
                                    satisfy one of the multiple unknown variables. If not, consider whether another formula with most unknowns satisfied could be identified or derived. When deriving formulas, consider whether other formulas
                                    contain variables that would resolve to the given quantities, and whether the unknown in such a formula would solve an unknown in another formula for which most of the variables are known. Knowledge of
                                    Calculus can be helpful for deriving formulas, as well as Linear Algebra, for solving systems of equations. When the formulaic path from input to output is not apparent, extrapolating more information
                                    increases the likelihood that a connection will eventually be identified. In gaming terms, this could be described as ‘grinding’, but with the reward that one may begin to develop a stronger intuition of
                                    the inner-workings of the material world to better anticipate the path to subsequent solutions. The solution should be reasonable and if not, review your steps checking for computational or logical
                                    errors.

                                    In determining the formulas that most closely relate to the logical conditions of the problem, it may help to distinguish related but disparate contexts: system composition (single particle, multiple
                                    particle), system dynamics (isolated system, affected system), rate of change (instantaneous, average), path of motion (linear, rolling, angular, uniform circular), etc.

                                    In determining a path to the solution, it may help to distinguish the subjects that underpin the logical conditions of a problem. Frequently reappearing in later subjects in different forms are the
                                    kinematics formulas: constant acceleration, force, energy (kinetic/potential), work, momentum, etc.

                                <u><p>Applications</p></u>
                                <br />
                                <p>Quantum properties can be demonstrated by the particles of an electromagnetic wave or matter wave, directed at a polarizing apparatus, such as a light filter or a calcite crystal.  Because the particles of an electromagnetic wave (photons) and matter wave (subatomic, atomic, or molecular particles) demonstrate quantum properties, these particles are referred to as, ‘quantum particles’. A quantum particle is hereafter referred to as, ‘particle’, a system of quantum particles is hereafter referred to as, ‘particle stream’, and a polarizing apparatus is hereafter referred to as, ‘apparatus’.  The angle of polarization of a particle is a description of its electromagnetic oscillation. The angle of polarization of an apparatus is a description of its impedance orientation.</p>

  	<p>A particle is considered to be aligned if the particle has the same polarization as the polarization of the apparatus. A particle is considered to be antialigned if the particle has the orthogonal (90° apart) polarization to the polarization of the apparatus. An aligned particle is always yielded, and an antialigned particle is always blocked, by the apparatus.  For example, an apparatus polarized at 45° always yields a particle polarized at 45°; an apparatus polarized at 90° always blocks a particle polarized at 0°. </p>

  	<p>When a particle is either aligned or antialigned, the correspondence between initial and final particle state is absolute, so the behavior of the particle is characterized as deterministic.  The discrete probability that a particle with deterministic behavior is yielded by the apparatus is always either 0% or 100%.  This probability can be expressed as a boolean (0 or 1). Quantum properties do not manifest when a particle behaves deterministically. </p>

  	<p>When a particle is neither aligned nor antialigned with the apparatus, a probability exists that the particle is either yielded or blocked, by the apparatus. In this scenario, the probability is random that a particle is either yielded or blocked by the apparatus, so the behavior of the particle is characterized as probabilistic.  The discrete probability that a particle with probabilistic behavior is yielded by the apparatus is always between 0% and 100%.  This probability can be expressed as a combination of possible states, which is called a superposition. </p>

  	<p>The polarization of a particle is measured by interaction with the apparatus, so the interaction between particles and apparatus is hereafter referred to as, measurement. Particles with probabilistic behavior when measured by the apparatus lose their initial polarization state. Those particles that are yielded inherit the same polarization as the polarization of the apparatus, while those particles that are blocked inherit the orthogonal polarization to the polarization of the apparatus.  After measurement, the particles are either aligned or antialigned with the apparatus, so their behavior becomes deterministic; superposition is lost, and subsequent measurements with the apparatus produce the same result. </p>

  	<p>Quantum state provides a probability distribution for the spin directions of a particle stream. A quantum system can exist as a single particle or multiple particle.  Quantum state is represented as an element of a vector space spanned by all possible states. A vector space is any nonempty set of elements i.e. objects called vectors upon which are defined operations of addition and scalar multiplication (i.e. <i>a + bx</i>) that satisfy the axioms in the definition of a vector space. A vector can be embodied not only by a single-column or single-row matrix, but also by any object satisfying the axioms of a vector space including a real-valued function or a polynomial. Quantum state is represented as a single-column matrix i.e. a column vector.</p>

  	<p>The entries of the quantum state vector correspond to the square roots of spin probabilities. For a single-particle system, the first entry corresponds to the probability that the measured spin will be down, while the second entry corresponds to the probability that the measured spin will be up.  For a particle that is aligned with the apparatus (e.g. both polarized at 90°), the probability that the measured spin will be down is 0% and up is 100%, so the state vector entries are (0, 1).  For a particle that is antialigned with the apparatus (e.g. particle polarized at 0°, apparatus polarized at 90°), the probability that the measured spin will be down is 100% and up is 0%, so the state vector entries are (1, 0).</p>

  	<p>The polarization of a particle can be characterized by the probability of the particle existing in one of two states (e.g. 0° or 90°). This probability can be associated with a boolean (0 or 1), and is referred to as spin direction (0 is down; 1 is up).  In classical computing, bits are represented by electronic switches existing in one of two states – off (0) or on (1). In quantum computing, qubits are represented by either the probability of a particle existing in one of two states – down (0) or up (1) – or a combination of probabilities of a particle existing in either state. Sequences of bits or qubits represent information. </p>

  	<p>For a particle that is neither aligned nor antialigned with the apparatus (e.g. particle polarized at 0° or 90°, apparatus polarized at 45°) the probability that the measured spin will be either up or down is 50%, so the state vector entries are the square root of 50%, or (1/√2, 1/√2). The qubit associated with such a particle exists as the simultaneous superposition of states, with each state represented as the square root of the probability that a spin direction will result from measurement. The state vectors of (0, 1) and (1, 0) form an orthonormal (orthogonal unit) basis for the vector space spanned by, and as such can be scaled to compose, all possible state vectors e.g. (1/√2, 1/√2) = 1/√2 (1, 0) + 1/√2 (0, 1).  A multi-qubit system is described by additional state vector entries that represent the probabilities of combinations of spin directions e.g. 11, 01, 10, 00. Under certain conditions, states of quantum particles in a multi-qubit system can develop a connection, called entanglement, that is maintained despite physical distance such that the states and behavior of the particles are the same.</p>

  	<p>Bra-ket notation describes quantum state. A ket (denoted as |<i>Ψ</i>>) is the quantum state, or particle spin, column vector.  A bra (denoted as <<i>β</i>|) is the adjoint (transpose of the complex conjugate) of the apparatus spin column vector, which is a row vector. Bra represents measurement which is a linear transformation (transformation preserving vector addition and scalar multiplication) that maps a vector in ket vector space to a number in the complex plane of form <i>a + bi</i>; i being imaginary.  A ket represented by a subtractive square root of particle spin probabilities can be complex because the probability difference under the radical can be negative. The inner product of the bra and ket (the sum of products of corresponding bra and ket entries) is the probability that the particle will measure with upward spin, where <i>i<sup>2</sup> </i>= -1.</p>
